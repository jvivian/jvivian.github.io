                <h2>
                    Budapest Day 1
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sam and I arrived and were able to get two tickets into Budapest for 1800 forint (~260 forint per
                    $1).
                    After a bit of difficulty locating the AirBnB, we met our host Elizabeth (Erzsebet),
                    who used to be a tour guide, and she gave us some helpful advice about what to see,
                    what food we should try, and to beware of PÃ¡linka -
                    a traditional fruit brandy that is strong and doesn't taste like liquor.
                    Our residence was nestled in complex away from the busy streets with a large garden in
                    the middle so not only was it beautful but we also weren't bothered by
                    the noise of Budapest's vibrant night life. Sam and I were rather tired from our nearly 24
                    hours of straight travel and ended up falling asleep for several hours, but we forced ourselves
                    to get up so that we could get to bed by midnight and try and get our circadian rhythm in line
                    with the new time zone. That night we simply wandered around the area admiring the
                    incredible views available of the Danube at night.

                <h2>
                    Budapest Day 2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got up early the next morning and had some coffee at a cafe close to our residence. Budapest has
                    a huge coffee culture, which I appreciate, and almost every outdoor cafe sells espresso or coffee in
                    some form. We joined a free walking tour that morning and saw St. Peters Basilica, the Parliment
                    building, and the palace which had a fantastic view of the Danube and Pest, which is on the East of
                    the Danube. We met two other Americans on the walking tour, Brewa and Myron, who work in the airline
                    industry and were on the last leg of their vacation. We later met them at Rudas, a traditional
                    turkish bathhouse located in Buda. Upon entering the bathhouse a gruff looking hungarian repeatedly
                    barked "no shorts" at us and pointed to these small 1' by 8" aprons that we were supposed to wear
                    that provided little modesty and since they were white, were pointless once you entered the water.
                    After the initial culture shock we ended have a very pleasant time. There were 4 smaller pools in
                    the corners of the room, starting at 28C and increasing by ~2C. There was a 5th very large pool in
                    the center that was 36C and the hottest pool was a blistering 42C. There were two saunas, a hot
                    "dry" sauna and a steam room sauna which was so thick with steam you couldn't see more than a couple
                    of feet and it was very difficult to breathe upon first entering. The exits of the sauna also had
                    these huge buckets full of very cold water that you could pull on to dump on your head, and moving
                    between the hottest and coldest pools was a rather tittilatting experience. Sam and I had such a
                    good time with Brewa and Myron we ended up hanging out with them the rest of the night, exploring
                    downtown Pest until 1 in the morning, drinking Palinko with a wonderful waitress named Nora who had
                    spent some time in America as a child learning english, and ending the night by ravenously devouring
                    a 30-piece bucket of KFC, which our compatriots pronounced "K-FuCk", in a little over 5 minutes.
                    Surprisingly, it was some of the best fried chicken we'd ever eaten and far cry from the quality of
                    food you'd get at an American KFC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Budapest Day 3
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the third day we decided to explore Margaret Island, situated in the middle of the Danube north
                    of where we were staying. It'd be hard to overstate what a beautiful place it was â it was
                    impressively manicured, featured large and elaborate fountains, a small zoo, and the Rose Garden.
                    The Rose Garden felt like something that would be almost impossible to maintain in America âÂ my
                    assumption being that parents would let their kids run all over the plants and people would steal or
                    take flowers, but that may be unfair cynicism. Serendipitously, on our way back from Margaret Island
                    I received a notification from an old colleague that he was also in Budapest, having left a
                    bioinformatics conference in Prague earlier that day. We met him and a few other PhD students who
                    worked at the University in Budapest and enjoyed going out on the town with them. Ending our trek at
                    2AM with a satisfying street Doner Kebab and a beer, agreeing to meet the next morning for a
                    traditional Hungarian brunch.

                    Budapest Day 4
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our last day in Budapest, we were able to meetup with Lawrence (native Hungarian), Mario (NIH
                    researcher), and Eli (my former colleague) for brunch which consisted of many... interesting meats
                    like blood sausage, liver sausauge, pork shoulder, schnitzel and chicken kiev. Sides included
                    potatoes and onions, and about 5 different pickled items. After brunch and saying our goodbyes, Sam
                    and I hung out at a local park near Deak Square until it was time to catch our flight to Berlin. We
                    arrived in Tiegal airport (TXL) late due to an unexplained delay and finally got our keys to the
                    AirBnB in Alexanderplatz at 11:30PM. We went out exploring for food and were fortunate to find that
                    a festival of some sort is going on at Alexanderplatz this weekend and we grubbed to our hearts
                    content on currywurst and nutella crepes before heading back to the apartment to sleep.

                <h2>Berlin Day 1</h2>
                <p>
                    On our first full day, Sam and I took the public transport down to Kreuzberg to have brunch with
                    Ittai, a professor who I had the opportunity to take a music theory class over summer before
                    starting the masters program at UCSC. We ate salad and homemade bread with Ittai and his friend
                    David, who was visiting from Israel. We made plans to travel to Schlachtensee the next day via bike,
                    before Sam and I bade farewell and decided to walk north back to Alexanderplatz and see some sights,
                    like Berlin's infamous graffiti and Checkpoint Charlie. We then traveled southwest to eat a classic
                    German dinner at a spot Sam found online called Stadtkraus. The surrounding area was beautiful,
                    featuing modern architecture, parks, and a few small rivers. We kept walking North to see "The
                    Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe" and reached Brandenberg Tor just as the sun was setting. We
                    went to bed early that night as Ittai wanted to leave our place by 8:30 for the bike ride.

                <h2>
                    Berlin Day 2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got up early to go rent a bike and came back to the house to find Sam wasn't feeling well, likely
                    due to dehydration as we'd been walking more than 10 miles a day on average and Berlin was 85-90F
                    with high humidity, and decided he'd stay and rest up. Ittai, David, and I then biked ~30km to get
                    to Schlachtensee, which was a difficult trek to make on a less-than-great rental bike. We met
                    Ittai's friend, also from Israel, who worked in the city as a nanny and sings in her free time. We
                    enjoyed the lake before my stomach reminded me I hadn't eaten breakfast, and after some tasty
                    bratwurst and pomme frites we began our arduous journey - this time through the south-east - back to
                    Kreuzberg where Ittai and David split off and I made my way back to the apartment. Sam had only
                    woken a couple hours before I arrived back and we went out and got a quick snack of schnitzel,
                    potatotes, andv veggies which made the both of us feel better. After biking 60km I needed a nap,
                    after which Sam and I left to meet Ittai and David for a classic German dinner at Metzer Eck which
                    was only a 10 minute walk away. We ended the night by walking around the area and getting some tasty
                    gelato.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Berlin Day 3
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our way to Metzer Eck the night before, Sam and I had seen a place that looked like it'd be good
                    for breakfast called "Cafe Hilde", and ate there that morning. The food was delicious and I can
                    safely say I had the best eggs benedict I've ever eaten! Berlin was pretty miserable during the day,
                    so we decided it'd be best to find a museum or some other attraction that featured air-conditioning.
                    Fortunately for us we'd seen signs for "BodyWorld", an exhibit highlighting the human body that my
                    friend Kaia had gone to in LA and absolutely loved, and it was taking place in the museum in
                    Alexanderplatz. BodyWorld was possibly the best museum I've ever been to, which told a story of the
                    human body through human dissections that had been preserved via plastication, a technique invented
                    by the creator of almost all the exhibits. BodyWorld first walked the attendee through the basic
                    anatomy of the human body, reminding us of the difficult urges humans face when it comes to sugars,
                    fats, and drugs. The next section was devoted to movement and featured incredibly artisitic
                    dissections of humans in motion. The last few sections focused on the life cycle of humans,
                    reminding us how fortunate we are to be alive, being the result of the 1 in 400 million sperm to
                    make it to the egg, and ending with a section on the fragility of life and to spend our time here in
                    a meaningful way while keeping the vessel we use, our body, healthy and capable. BodyWorld was an
                    incredibly impactful exhibit, although not for the squeamish. For dinner that night Sam found us a
                    great burger place after which we retired back to the apartment - stopping to get some gelato of
                    course.

                    Hilde's was too good to only visit once, so we ate there again on our last day before heading to
                    Berlin's southern airport for our flight to Amsterdam. We got into Amsterdam and bought 72 hour
                    travel passes which worked on any bus or tram in Amsterdam, and traveled and then tram to get to our
                    apartment in West Amsterdam only a couple blocks East from the center of Rembrandt Park. Our
                    minimalist apartment was both modern as well as beautiful, and most importantly had the best shower
                    of any of our previous apartments. It was getting late by the time we'd gotten settled in, so we
                    chose to walk around and familiarize ourselves with the area near our apartment before heading in
                    for the night.

                <h2>Amsterdam Day 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Sam and I decided to find a breakfast spot near the western entrance of Vondelpark which we knew we
                    could walk through to in order to get to the Centruum, Amsterdam's dense central area. We ate at a
                    new restaurant called Dignitas, and ended up talking to the owner who gave us short surveys with
                    which to provide feedback as the restaurant was still in the proof-of-concept stage. After breakfast
                    we walked through Vondelpark, which was the nicest park I've ever seen. Even during a weekday it was
                    packed with commuters on bikes, pedestrians, and dog-walkers. Unlike parks in America where junkies
                    and homeless congregate, this park was very well-maintained, clean, and was full of people taking
                    advantage of its beauty to picnic and relax. Upon reaching the Centruum we strolled around and
                    looked at the menagerie of shops, bought some cheese to enjoy later, and bought pomme fritas to
                    enjoy right then. We went to a supermarket near the Museumplein and had a delicious lunch on the
                    slanted grass-covered roof of bread, cheese, salami, strawberries, chocolate milk, and of course
                    Stroopwaffel - a traditional dutch dessert of caramel pressed between two very thin waffle wafers
                    which are not brittle but soft and chewy. After stopping back at the apartment, we ended the night
                    by walking through the Centruum and enjoying the sights of Amsterdam's busy night life.

                <h2>
                    Amsterdam Day 2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a late start we ended up at a cafe on one of the canals in central Amsterdam and then did a
                    bit of gift shopping before heading to the Van Gogh Museum - an attraction I hadn't been able to go
                    the first time I was in Amsterdam 4-5 years ago. The Van Gogh featured an impressive 4 stories
                    dedicated to the life of Van Gogh and his works, with each floor covering a different period of the
                    painter's life. The progression of his work when he decided to become an artist at 27 to his death
                    at 31 was both inspiring as well as saddening - Van Gogh wanted so much to create art that could
                    convey strong emotion and feeling, yet had a hard time working with others and ended up alienating
                    many of his friends in his pursuits. After suffering a nervous breakdown, he was admitted to a
                    mental hospital where he lived out the last year of his life, painting on average one painting a
                    day, before committing suicide a year later. Based on the descriptions available, many believe he
                    suffered from bipolar disorder or some other manic disorder. Sam and I walked back through
                    Vondelpark to get home and packed up a bit in preparation for travel back to the United States the
                    next day.
