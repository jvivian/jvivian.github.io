As a heads up, I can't even be mean to NPCs so I'm not going to be good at telling the type of depraved jokes Nate actually _wants_ to hear. I'll leave those to Reed, Dillon, and of course the meanest hater here, Hannah. I thought I'd start by talking about how I first came to know Nate. I moved into his room to live with my guitarist Reed and his buddy Steve. They gave me the lowdown on Nate and that's probably why his name is still in my phone as...

which probably tells you all you need to know about Nate.

Nate loves self-deprecating humor, so a roast makes perfect sense. He would be sort of like the group's self-hating Jew, except he's terrible with money and doesn't have the chutzpah to dig any tunnels. To gain more insight into this more-neanderthal-than-man, let's delve into some its stats.

Wow. What a piece of shit. Aside from fucking up young chilren's perceptions of decent human behavior, Nate also fucked up being a proper blasphemer

- Nate is raised non-religious, free from the burden of indoctrination (Atheists=3, Christians=0)
- Nate rebels against his parents, but instead of doing actual cool activities like arson or smoking cigarettes he becomes a Christian (Christianity + 1)
- Nate's piety convinces his parents to become religious (Christianity + 2)
- Nate realizes August Burns Red peaked after _Messengers_ and ditches god for weed, plowing, and slightly less shitty metal (Christianity - 1)

**Result**: Net win for Christianity

Nate has a lot of quality features. None of which is friends don't already have better versions of, but he's appreciated, like a backup allele or a codon table. Having some unique quality is probably why he's been telling everyone how hip and bisexual he is.

But Nate doesn't just share redundant features, he shares with his friends. Or more accurately, overshares with his friends. For example, thanks to Nate's love of sharing many of us have been unburdened from such pesky troubles such as "knowing there's a twist in this movie and vaguely what form it takes and when." Or knowing pretty much exactly what Nate looks like when he's taking a shit

I hate to do this while we're having a good time but I'm going to take a pause from this japery and talk about some real serious shit. (Dim the lights if possible)

Quote, DSM-V, Criteria for substance abuse disorder: Craving to use the substance, wanting to cut down or stop and not being able to, taking the substance in large amounts or for longer than you're meant to, neglecting other parts of your life because of use, continuing to use even when it causess problems in your relationships, using substances even when it puts you in danger. As many of you have guessed...

I'm talking about World of Warcraft. This piece of shit has quit playing WoW 4-5 times now. Spurning his real world friends to hang out with cryptocurrency incels. Tsk tsk. Before any of us can spend any more time thinking about substance abuse and how these definitions may apply to us, I want to draw us back to the focus of why we're here.j

It's always nice to make friends with someone you know you'll definitely see in hell. To cap things off, I just wanted to share an example of Nate in his natural habit enjoying something he loves
